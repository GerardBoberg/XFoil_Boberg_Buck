# XFoil_Boberg_Buck
XFoil from scratch project

This was a project for the class AERO 306 -- Aerodynamics and Flight Performance

The goal was to create an inviscid flow analysis that could predict lift characteristics on arbitrary airfoils.

The project was technically successful, but results from the analysis are systematically flawed due to assumptions
made and information constraints.
